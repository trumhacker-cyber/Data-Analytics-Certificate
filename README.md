## Introduction

Data Analytics is an exciting field that combines statistics, technology, and critical thinking. In this repository, I document my learning process and projects that demonstrate my skills. Each project reflects a specific area of data analytics, from data cleaning to visualization and reporting.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a wide range of topics, including:

- **Excel**: Data manipulation and analysis using Excel.
- **Matplotlib**: Creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical computations in Python.
- **Oracle**: Database management and querying.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- **Power BI**: Business analytics service for visualizing data.
- **Tableau**: Interactive data visualization software.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for database management.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on topics. Each folder contains:

- **Code Files**: Python scripts, SQL queries, or Excel files.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs created during the projects.
- **Reports**: Final reports summarizing the findings.
